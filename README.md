# Octordle

Octordle is a fun take on the popular word-guessing game, Wordle. Instead of only having to guess one word at a time, this game gives you 13 guesses to guess 8 words. It's a true brain-teaser. 

I used to play this game all the time but was never quite able to get the website capability to functon right on my phone so I decided to build an iOS app for it!

(make sure to add a dictionary on your device or emulator in order to ensure the app works as intended)
